# Brain Mri Classification
 This project uses transfer learning with DenseNet121 to classify Brain MRI images, identifying brain tumors (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, or No Tumor) and Alzheimer's severity (No Dementia, Mild, Moderate, or Very Mild Dementia). It incorporates advanced data augmentation, class balancing, and a two-phase training strategy, achieving 94% test accuracy.
